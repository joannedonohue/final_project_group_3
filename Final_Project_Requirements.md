# 23	Final Project Overview

For the Final Project, you will work with your group to collaboratively solve or analyze a problem using advanced ML methodologies. In your solution, you will incorporate transformer models, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and other tools acquired throughout the course, in addition to at least one new technology that we haven’t covered together.

## Here are the specific requirements:

1.	Identify a problem worth solving or analyzing.
2.	Find a dataset or datasets that are sufficiently large enough to effectively train a ML model or neural network with a high degree of accuracy to ensure that your results are reliable.
3.	Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.

4.	You must use at least two of the following:

    •	scikit-learn
    •	Keras
    •	TensorFlow
    •	Hugging Face
    •	spaCy or Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
    •	LangChain
    •	OpenAI

5.	You must use one additional library or technology NOT covered in class, such as:

    •	Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER)

    •	Whisper (OpenAI’s automatic speech recognition system)
  	
    •	DALL·E (OpenAI’s text-to-image model)

    •	Other OpenAI capabilities, including:

        o	Text-to-speech
  	
        o	GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V)

    •	PyTorch

For this project, you can focus your efforts within a specific industry, as detailed in the following examples.

# Finance
•	Build a customer service chatbot for a financial firm that analyzes a user’s request and makes customized recommendations in one or more languages.

•	Develop a deep learning model that forecasts and predicts stock prices for at least three publicly traded companies.

•	Use NLP, transformers, or OpenAI to summarize key takeaways from a company’s earnings call.

# Healthcare
•	Build a transformer model that captions medical images in one or more languages.

•	Develop a deep learning model to distinguish between malignant and benign moles.

•	Use NLP to de-identify medical data such as name, birthdate, and ID number.

# Custom
We’ve only specified healthcare and finance, but any industry can benefit from applying NLP, transformers, or OpenAI technologies. Consider preparing a data deep dive or infrastructure review that shows ML in the context of what we’ve already learned.

•	Develop an integrated AI model that accurately detects and filters out spam messages.

•	Use NLP to analyze social media data or customer reviews to understand user sentiment about a product, service, or issue.

•	Develop a transformer model that translates between two or more languages of your choice.

## Working with Your Group

When working on an online group project, it’s crucial to meet with your group and communicate regularly. Plan for significant collaboration time outside of class. The following tips can help you make the most of your time:

•	Decide how you’re going to communicate with your group members when you begin. Create a Slack channel, exchange phone numbers, and ensure that the group knows each group member’s available working hours.

•	Set up an agile project by using GitHub Projects so that your group can track tasks.

•	Create internal milestones to ensure that your group is on track. Set due dates for these milestones so that you have a timeline for completing the project. Some of these milestones might include:

    o	Project ideation;
    
    o	Data fetching;
    
    o	Data exploration;
    
    o	Data transformation;
    
    o	Data analysis;
    
    o	Data cleaning and preprocessing
    
    o	Testing ML models;
    
    o	Integrate AI tools into the project for deployment
    
    o	Creating documentation; and
    
    o	Creating the presentation.

Since this is a two-week project, make sure that you have completed at least half of your project by the end of the first week in order to stay on track.

Although you will divide the work among the group members, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your teammates regularly and offer support.

# Support and Resources

Your instructional team will provide support during classes and office hours. You will also have access to learning assistants and tutors to help you with topics as needed. Make sure to take advantage of these resources as you collaborate with your group on this project.
